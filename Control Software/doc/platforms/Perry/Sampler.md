# Liquid Handler Sampler usage


    Handles communication with a CNC-based sampler.
    The device is documented in detail at https://github.com/Noel-Research-Group/liquid_handler_cnc .

    Usage:
        First, connect to the device with
        `self.open('COM4')`

        Then, change parameters of the device with
        `self['parameter_name'] = xyz`

        or read parameters with
        `xyz = self['parameter_name']`

        For a detailed list of available parameters, call
        `self.parameters()`

        For a human-readable list of parameters, call
        `print(self.usage())`

        Finally, close the device with
        `self.close()`

    Notes on Grbl settings:
        The user must take care that grbl is properly set up for the machine in use.
        In addition, homing cycle ($22) must be enabled. Therefore, the machine needs physical endstops.
        It is advised to also enable softlimits ($20) and hard limits ($21) and set accurate values for the
        maximum travel setting of each axis.

    This code has been written and tested with grbl v0.9j.

            Data is a dictionary itself, which must specify:
             - type: "type"
                At the moment, "injection_port" and "holder" are supported.
             - position: {"x": "10.0mm", "y": "10.0mm" (, "z": "10.0mm")}
                Use SI units: mm, cm ecc...
                z position is only used for injection port.
             - shape: "shape"
                This is only for holders. It must match a holder type from the 'sample_holder_types' config file.
            Example:
            "setup": {
              "locations": {
